# Contributing to VRAM Calculator

We welcome contributions from the community! Here’s how you can contribute:

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Proposing Changes

We use GitHub Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. Here’s how to propose changes:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Follow the branch naming convention: `feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/your-bugfix-name`.
3. If you’ve added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you’ve changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Ensure your code lints.
7. Submit your pull request!

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- You can run `npm run lint` to unify the style.

## Best Practices

- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Keep pull requests small and focused.
- Ensure your changes are well-tested.
- Update documentation as needed.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VRAM Calculator!
